# Spell

### preconditionsSatisfied :: (SpellTarget) -> Boolean

This function is used to determine whether it's possible to cast the spell
on the given target. Depending on the return value, the engine will continue
with either `startSpellcast` or `failSpellcast`.


### failSpellcast :: (SpellTarget) ->

This function is called when the preconditions are not satisfied.


### startSpellcast :: (SpellTarget) ->

Called when all preconditions are satisfied and the unit is about to start
casting the spell. After a certaine amount of time (cast time), it'll be
followed by `finishSpellcast` (unless the spellcasting is canceled or
interrupted).


### finishSpellcast :: (SpellTarget) ->

Called when the unit has finished casting the spell. Here you would apply the
spell effects to the target.


### cancelSpellcast :: (SpellTarget) ->

Called when the player cancels the spellcast out of his free will. Usually no
penalities will result when canceling a spellcast.


### interruptSpellcast :: (SpellTarget) ->

Called when the spellcast was interrupted (by a counterspell for example).
This may result in penalties.


### handleEvent :: (Event) ->

Any event that is generated by the engine is passed to the spell that is being
cast. The spell has a chance to react on it. For example, interrupting the
spellcast if the object moves.
