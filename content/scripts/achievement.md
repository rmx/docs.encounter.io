# Script: Achievement

All achievement scripts are instantiated after the server has been initialized
and all players added to the game. All events that are generated by the engine
are passed to each script. The script then decides whether a player has earned
the achievement, and if yes then awards it.

The script **must not** modify the game state, it's purely an observer of the
running game. In particular, use of `eventSchedule` and similar functions is
forbidden.

`self` in achievement scripts refers to the Achievement. Use it as the second
argument of `awardAchievement`.


### handleEvent :: (Event) -> ignored

The script must implement this function. It is passed each event that is
generated by the game. This example awards each player in the game the
achievement when the game ends:

    handleEvent: (e) ->
        if (eventName e) == 'finishGame'
            forEach players, (x) -> awardAchievement x, self
