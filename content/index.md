# Introduction

Designers can specify many aspects of the encounter, including:

 - Units the players can choose and they fight against.
 - Spells and auras which are available.
 - Behavior of enemies.
 - Models and appearance of the units and world.
 - Achievements the players can collect.

The website includes an online encounter editor which you can use to edit the
files that make up the encounter, and test the encounter before releasing it
to the public.
