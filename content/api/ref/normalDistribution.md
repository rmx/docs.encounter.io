### normalDistribution :: (Number, Number, Number) -> Number

Return a uniformly distributed random number. Because normal distribution has
no bounds, it's desirable to clamp the result to a specific range. The third
argument is used to specify the range (in the number of stddev multiplies
around the median).

## Example

Random number with median 10 and standard deviation 2. The result is clamped
to Â± 6 (2*3) around the median. That means x will be always between 4 and 16.

    x = normalDistribution 10, 2, 3
