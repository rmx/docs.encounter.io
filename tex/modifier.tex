\chapter{Modifier}

\section{Stacking}

Each modifier can be assigned one (arbitrarily named) stacking category.
If multiple modifiers are active, only the strongest one from each category applies.
How modifiers from different stacking categories stack (multiplicative, additive, ...) is defined by the modifier.

\section{List of modifiers}

Modifiers affecting effects are described in the respective sections.
